## Getting Started

To use this website just click into the index.html file and live preview


## Development

For this lab I mainly followed all of the hints provided 

I used the flexbox to get my nav items in a row and spaced it using space-between. For the sticky navigation bar I used sticky for the positioning. I used the float property to wrap the text around the image.


## Accessibility

I updated the tab index so the website is accessible using the tab button
